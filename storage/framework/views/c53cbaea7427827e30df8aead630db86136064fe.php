<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department. These departments have different safety checklists. So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data. This submitted data is seen by the admin and department heads. The submit action triggers an email to the relevant department head with the checklist document as an attachment.</span></p>

Basically it’s sort of a ticket system with high and low escalation levels.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department.

So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per </span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">This feature is basically the system storage for the attachments uploaded in the system. Users can upload attachments and share the attachments with other users using their emails or system usernames. The user who has uploaded the file can share it or make it private…depends on his/her choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">Basically the admin can view all uploaded files in the system. This is the module description.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department. These departments have different safety checklists. So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data. This submitted data is seen by the admin and department heads. The submit action triggers an email to the relevant department head with the checklist document as an attachment.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">This feature is basically the system storage for the attachments uploaded in the system. Users can upload attachments and share the attachments with other users using their emails or system usernames. The user who has uploaded the file can share it or make it private…depends on his/her choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">Basically the admin can view all uploaded files in the system. This is the module description.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department. These departments have different safety checklists. So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data. This submitted data is seen by the admin and department heads. The submit action triggers an email to the relevant department head with the checklist document as an attachment.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">This feature is basically the system storage for the attachments uploaded in the system. Users can upload attachments and share the attachments with other users using their emails or system usernames. The user who has uploaded the file can share it or make it private…depends on his/her choice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department. These departments have different safety checklists. So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data. This submitted data is seen by the admin and department heads. The submit action triggers an email to the relevant department head with the checklist document as an attachment.</span></p>

So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill </span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">text areas then submit the data.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department. These departments have different safety checklists. So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data. This submitted data is seen by the admin and department heads. The submit action triggers an email to the relevant department head with the checklist document as an attachment.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have a notification feature where any response made to a ticket is sent via email and also the user gets a notification in his/her dashboard on the notification section. The main mode of communication in the system is via the system emails and notifications.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">User Management feature (system vision)</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">*************************</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have user levels as any other system where we have the super admin then we have the departmental admin (department heads) then we have the normal users. Basically there are roles that the super admin and admin have that are similar but there are those that the admin does not have and the super admin has.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">File Management/ Document Management Module (system vision)</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">**************************************************************************</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">This feature is basically the system storage for the attachments uploaded in the system. Users can upload attachments and share the attachments with other users using their emails or system usernames. The user who has uploaded the file can share it or make it private…depends on his/her choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">Basically the admin can view all uploaded files in the system. This is the module description.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">Data Capture feature (system vision)</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">***********************</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system will have Departments in dropdown boxes e.g. IT Department, HR Department. These departments have different safety checklists. So the data editor will pick a department from the dropdown then that specific departments’ checklist will be loaded into set fields that have checkboxes and textarea form fields. The data editor can add checklist items or remove them. These items will be loaded to data capture users where they will just be marking the checkboxes then click on a submit button to submit the data for that specific department.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">So we have two user levels in this…the Admin who adds the checklist items per department then a Safety Officer who will just load checklist items based on the department they belong in and they will be picking items from checkboxes and fill text areas then submit the data. This submitted data is seen by the admin and department heads. The submit action triggers an email to the relevant department head with the checklist document as an attachment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">Ticket feature (system vision)</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">*************************</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 12pt;">The system has an inbuilt ticket feature which any issue raised has a reposes level which is number of days, if there is no response made towards that issue, the item is escalated to another high level user via email This happens until the issue is resolved and eventually closed. Basically it’s sort of a ticket system with high and low escalation levels.</span></p>
